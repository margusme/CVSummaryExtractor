To use Java operations with keeping JVM constantly running and therefore reducing time cost for every document
transformation from .doc/.pdf/.odf etc. format to plain text format, a separate utility nailgun should be installed.

The following applies to Centos 7.1 but with some modifications can be used elsewhere.

1. copy nailgun-server-0.9.2.jar to the folder where you want to run it (/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/)
2. copy ng to the folder where you want to run it (/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/)

To build the client ng and server nailgun-server-0.9.2.jar, run the following:
1. git clone https://github.com/martylamb/nailgun
2. cd nailgun
3. make && sudo make install
4. mvn clean install
If the last command will not work you probably want to install maven via
sudo yum install maven
or just copy the already made .jar to the end folder on Centos machine.

1. Start the ng server via
java -jar /YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/nailgun-server-0.9.2.jar
2. Then register it with
/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/ng ng-cp /YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/tika-app-1.9.jar
3. Use it with
/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME/ng org.apache.tika.cli.TikaCLI --encoding=UTF-8 --text "/YOUR_CV_FOLDER_NAME/YOUR_CV.doc"
