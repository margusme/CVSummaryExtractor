cpp-netlib is a collection of network related routines/implementations geared towards providing a robust cross-platform
networking library.

To build it manually from release version:
1. Install all required packages if these are not installed: openssl, threads
2. Download the latest from https://github.com/cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib/downloads
3. Unpack
4. cd cpp-netlib
5. Edit CMakeLists.txt
a. Add the following line just below line project(CPP-NETLIB):
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
b.Comment out the following lines by adding #:
    add_subdirectory(libs/network/test)
    if (NOT MSVC)
      add_subdirectory(libs/mime/test)
    endif(NOT MSVC)
    add_subdirectory(libs/network/example)
c. Add line
add_definitions(-DBOOST_NETWORK_ENABLE_HTTPS)
after the line
add_definitions(-DNETWORK_ENABLE_HTTPS)
6. mkdir build
7. cd build
8. cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
9. make

It will result in three static libraries libcppnetlib-client-connections.a, libcppnetlib-server-parsers.a and
libcppnetlib-uri.a in build/libs/network/src/. Copy these to the libs/Darwin or libs/Linux (MAC or Centos builds) folder
of CVSummaryExtractor. Please see http://cpp-netlib.org/0.9.4/getting_started.html for more.

To build it manually from developer version (this should not be used until clear how to get that handle web requests):
1. Install all required packages if these are not installed: icu, doxygen, openssl, threads
2. git clone https://github.com/cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib
3. cd cpp-netlib
4. The project contains submodules for some dependencies and some libraries. Once you have cloned cpp-netlib, you must
update the submodules:
a. git submodule init
b. git submodule update
5. Edit CMakeLists.txt
a. find option CPP-NETLIB_BUILD_TESTS and set it OFF
b. find option CPP-NETLIB_BUILD_EXAMPLES and set it OFF
6. mkdir build
7. cd build
8. cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
9. make

It will result in single static library libcppnetlib.a in build/. Copy it to the libs folder of CVSummaryExtractor and modify
CVSummaryExtractor project file CMakeLists.txt.
